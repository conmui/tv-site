    "summary": "Contract killer Barry Berkman arrives in Los Angeles, hired by Chechen mob boss Goran Pazar to kill Ryan Madison for having an affair with Goran's wife. Barry follows Ryan to an acting class taught by Gene Cousineau, where Ryan convinces Barry to perform a scene with him. Despite a poor performance, Ryan befriends Barry and invites him to a bar with the class, where Barry takes an interest in actor Sally Reed. Barry drives a drunk Ryan home, which is witnessed by Noho Hank, Goran's second-in-command. The next day, Barry's handler Monroe Fuches arrives and warns Barry that the Chechens will kill them if Barry does not kill Ryan. That night, Barry tells Gene that he is a hitman but wants a different life. Gene, believing the confession is an improvised performance, gives Barry another chance at his class, and Barry introduces himself as \"Barry Block\", a stage name Ryan devised. Barry decides to kill Ryan but finds Ryan already dead and the Chechens prepared to shoot him, too. Barry shoots the Chechens, unaware that their lipstick camera has recorded him. At a nearby diner, while police cars speed past, Barry tells his waitress that he is an actor."
